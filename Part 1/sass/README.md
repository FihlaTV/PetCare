## SASS Instructions
1. Install SASS: http://sass-lang.com/install
2. cd into the /sass folder and run: sass --watch style.scss:style.css --style expanded
3. Make your changes to the .scss files and hit save and any changes will be saved to the style.css file. 
	* Don't make changes to the style.css file directly or they will be overwritten.
	* I created files under /sass/pages where you can make your changes depending on what page you are working on. This doesn't really matter so you can work on any of these files.
4. Commit all changes made to the /sass folder.

- If you can't get SASS to work, create another style1.css file and link it in the html file and I can add it to the scss files when everything is done.
- I created a template.html file that will include the navigation bar and footer so that you can make a copy and edit the content.
